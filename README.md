# Code Refactor Challenge
In this project I took an already completed piece of code and refactored it to include semantic elements within it's HTML file. I also added alt tags to the images to meet accessability standards that will allow the website to rank higher in terms of SEO scores.
## Usage
Open this projects HTML file in a live server, once opened right click the page and click on 'Inspect". From here you will see the webpages semantic HTML elements, as well as the alt tags that were applied to the pages images. The webpage to should look like the below image.
